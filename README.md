# [LiveSplit](http://livesplit.org/) Auto Splitters

A collection of auto splitters for LiveSplit (mostly in the form of ASL scripts) that I have made. Games that I currently have made auto splitters for:

* [Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition](/DarkSoulsASL)

You can refer to their individual folders for more information and details about how to use their respective auto splitter. 

For technical information on how LiveSplit auto splitters work, [see here](https://github.com/LiveSplit/LiveSplit/blob/master/Documentation/Auto-Splitters.md).
